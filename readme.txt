Allows the website owner to track the number of published comments on their blog over time.

== Description ==
The Historical Comment Count plugin is a small WordPress plugin designed to allow the website administrator to quickly keep track of the number of published blog comments over time.  It tracks the published comments and tallies them month by month.

It also allows the website administrator to drill down to the day-to-day level in a given month to see how many comments have been made and which posts have been the most popular.
